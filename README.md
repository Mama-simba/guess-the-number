## Overview

## The challenge

This game is based on this [course's project](https://fun-javascript-projects.com/) to put in practise some JavaScript concepts while having fun!
I have customised my own design, went through every concept that was new for me, researched about it to get a deeper understanding and rebuilt this project over and over again till I understand everything completely.
Try to practise on your own, google and make mistakes. If you get very stuck, have a look at the code.

### What I learned

JavaScript concepts to learn and practise:

- DOM Manipulation: selectors, style modifiers, event listeners, add classes

Happy coding! ðŸ¤“
